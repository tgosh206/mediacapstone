Media Capstone

My second capstone project for Thinkful, meant to display 1 or more API's.

Project Link:
https://tgosh206.github.io/mediacapstone/

Summary:
The app uses API's from two sources to display in three sections, Books, Movies, and TV. Shows movie posters and/or book covers, author(s), release dates, and average popularity rating. Meant to be responsive with navigation menu and scroll up option on smartphones and tablets.

First API: The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
- Used one movie search API, and one TV search API to display results from same source

Second API: Google Books (https://developers.google.com/books/)
- Used API to search by keyword
